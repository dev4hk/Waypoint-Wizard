# Waypoint Wizard

This project is to demonstrate & visualize a path finding technique by implementing A\* Search Algorithm in Angular

## Features

- Users can set up the size of a grid
- Users can set up a start node, an end node as well as wall nodes, which are obstacles that block the path
- Users can clear the set up and start over, or start simulating to find an optimal path from the start node to the end node
